Just sayin hey yall


I am a marine scientist working as a research technician at the Estuary and Ocean Science Center on the San Francisco Bay, where we study the effects of carbon dioxide on the environment by measuring proxies with field, pier and moored sensor platforms. With collected data and water samples we can assess the environmental conditions that calcifying organisms such as the native Olympia oyster, snails and mussels are experiencing. These organisms are sensitive to acidic conditions brought on by higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in bay water driven by fossil fuel combustion. This ocean and estuary acidification can inhibit growth for these critters early on and prevent them from growing into healthy structures that provide habitat, refuge and prey for many organisms in the SF Bay.

When I am not gallavanting about as a marine scientist I am cooking fine meals, tumbling in the surf, or hiking with my fiance and doggo in nature.
